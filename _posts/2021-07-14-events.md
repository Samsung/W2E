|exploit|['cve-2021-22555', 'kernel', 'xnu']|<p><strong>CVE-2021-22555</strong> (A heap out-of-bounds write affecting Linux since v2.6.19-rc1 was discovered in net/netfilter/x_tables.c. This allows an attacker to gain privileges or cause a DoS (via heap memory corruption) through user name space) is a 15 years old heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in Linux Netfilter that is powerful enough to bypass all modern security mitigations and achieve kernel code execution. It was used to break the kubernetes pod isolation of the <a href="https://google.github.io/kctf/vrp.html">kCTF cluster</a> and won 10000$ for charity (where Google will match and double the donation to 20000$).</p>|5|

|vulnerability|['apache', 'cyberattacker', 'facialrecognition', 'facial-recognition']|<p> Windows security bug would allow an attacker to fool a USB camera used in the biometric facial-recognition aspect of the system.</p><p>A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Windows 10 password-free authentication system has been uncovered that could allow an attacker to spoof an image of a person’s face to trick the facial-recognition system and take control of a device.</p><p>Windows Hello is <a href="https://threatpost.com/microsoft-reveals-which-bugs-it-wont-patch/132817/">a feature</a> in Windows 10 that allows users to authenticate themselves without a password, using a PIN code or biometric identity—either a fingerprint or facial recognition—to access a device or machine. According to Microsoft, about 85 percent of Windows 10 users <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/17/a-breakthrough-year-for-passwordless-technology/">use the system.</a></p><p>The Windows Hello bypass vulnerability, tracked as <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34466">CVE-2021-34466</a>, requires an attacker to have physical access to a device to exploit it, according to researchers at CyberArk Labs who discovered the flaw in March.</p><p>From there, they can go on “to manipulate the authentication process by capturing or recreating a photo of the target’s face and subsequently plugging in a custom-made USB device to inject the spoofed images to the authenticating host,” Omer Tsarfati, cybersecurity researcher at CyberArk Labs, wrote <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/bypassing-windows-hello-without-masks-or-plastic-surgery">in a report</a> about the vulnerability published Tuesday.</p><p>Further, exploitation of the bypass can extend beyond Windows Hello systems to “any authentication system that allows a pluggable third-party USB camera to act as biometric sensor,” Tsarfati noted.</p><p>Researchers have no evidence that anyone has tried or used the attack in the wild, but someone with motive could potentially use it on a targeted espionage victim, such as “a researcher, scientist, journalist, activist or privileged user with sensitive IP on their device, for example,” according to the analysis.</p><p>Microsoft addressed the vulnerability — which affects both consumer and business versions of the feature — in its <a href="https://threatpost.com/microsoft-crushes-116-bugs/167764/">July Patch Tuesday update.</a>Also, Windows users with Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security — a new <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/windows-hello-enhanced-sign-in-security">security feature</a> in Windows that requires specialized and pre-installed hardware, drivers and firmware — are protected against the any attacks “which tamper with the biometrics pipeline,” according to Microsoft.</p><p>However, Tsarfati said that the solution may not fully mitigate the issue.</p><p>“Based on our preliminary testing of the mitigation, using Enhanced Sign-in Security with compatible hardware limits the attack surface but is dependent on users having specific cameras,” he said. “Inherent to system design, implicit trust of input from peripheral devices remains. To mitigate this inherent trust issue more comprehensively, the host should validate the integrity of the biometric authentication device before trusting it.”</p><p><strong>Biometric Weakest Link</strong></p><p>CyberArk researchers posted a video of a proof-of-concept (PoC) for how to exploit the vulnerability, which can be used on both the consumer version, Windows Hello, and an enterprise version of the feature called Windows Hello for Business (WHfB) that businesses use with ActiveDirectory.</p><p>The bypass itself exploits a weakness in the biometric sensor of Windows Hello, which “transmits information on which the OS … makes its authentication decision,” he wrote. “Therefore, manipulating this information can lead to a potential bypass to the whole authentication system,” Tsarfati said.</p><p>For facial recognition, the biometric sensor is either a camera embedded in a device, such as a laptop, or connected to a computer via USB. Therefore, the entire process depends on this camera for proof of identity–which is where the vulnerability lies, particularly when a USB camera is used for authentication, he wrote.</p><p>“The answer lies in the input itself,” Tsarfati wrote. “Keyboard input is known only to the person who is typing before the information is entered into the system, while camera input isn’t.”</p><p>Therefore, using a camera to access “public” information—i.e., a person’s face—for authentication can easily be hijacked, he explained.</p><p>“It is similar to stealing a password, but much more accessible since the data (face) is out there,” Tsarfati wrote. “At the heart of this vulnerability lies the fact that Windows Hello allows external data sources, which can be manipulated, as a root of trust.”</p><p><strong>Attack Vector</strong></p><p>Researchers detailed a somewhat complex way for an attacker to capture someone’s image, save the captured frames, impersonate a USB camera device, and eventually send those frames to the Windows hello system for verification.</p><p>To prove the concept, they created a custom USB device that acts as a USB camera with both infrared (IR) and Red Green Blue (RGB) sensors, using an evaluation board manufactured by NXP. They used this custom camera to transmit valid IR frames of the person they were targeting, while sending the RGB frames image of the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants.</p><p>“To our surprise, it worked!” Tsarfati wrote.</p><p>Based on this understanding, an attacker would only need to  implement a USB camera that supports RGB and IR cameras and then send only one genuine IR frame of a victim to bypass the login phase of the device, while the RGB frames can contain any random image, he explained.</p><p>The entire process depends on an attacker having an IR frame of a potential victim to use in an attack, which can be done either by capturing one or converting one of the person’s regular RBG frames to an IR one, Tsarfati explained.</p><p>“Our findings show that any USB device can be cloned, and any USB device can impersonate any other USB device,” he said.  “We used the IR frames of a person to ‘bypass’ the face recognition mechanism. We believe that those IR frames can be created out of regular color images.”</p>|5|

|malware|['google', 'linkedin']|<p>Google <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/">has released new details</a> about four zero-day security vulnerabilities that were exploited in the wild earlier this year. Discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Project Zero researchers, the four zero-days were used as part of three targeted malware campaigns that exploited previously unknown flaws in Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, and WebKit, the browser engine used by Apple's Safari.</p><p>Google's researchers also noted that 2021 has been a particularly active year for in-the-wild zero-day attacks. So far this year, 33 zero-day exploits used in attacks have been publicly disclosed — 11 more than the total number from 2020.</p><p>Google attributes some of the uptick in zero-days to greater detection and disclosure efforts, but said the rise is also due to the proliferation of commercial vendors selling access to zero-day vulnerabilities as compared to the early 2010s.</p><p>"0-day capabilities used to be only the tools of select nation states who had the technical expertise to find 0-day vulnerabilities, develop them into exploits, and then strategically operationalize their use," Google said in a blog post. "In the mid-to-late 2010s, more private companies have joined the marketplace selling these 0-day capabilities. No longer do groups need to have the technical expertise, now they just need resources. Three of the four 0-days that TAG has discovered in 2021 fall into this category: developed by commercial providers and sold to and used by government-backed actors."</p><p>As for the zero-days discovered by Google, the exploits include CVE-2021-1879 in Safari, CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551 in Chrome, and CVE-2021-33742 in Internet Explorer.</p><p>With the Safari zero-day campaign, hackers used LinkedIn Messaging to target government officials from western European countries, sending malicious links that directed targets to attacker controlled domains. If the target clicked on the link from an iOS device, the infected website would initiate the attack via the zero-day.</p><p>"This exploit would turn off Same-Origin-Policy protections in order to collect authentication cookies from several popular websites, including Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Facebook and Yahoo and send them via WebSocket to an attacker-controlled IP," Google TAG researchers said. "The victim would need to have a session open on these websites from Safari for cookies to be successfully exfiltrated."</p><p>Google researchers said the attackers were likely part of a Russian government-backed actor abusing this zero-day to target iOS devices running older versions of iOS (12.4 through 13.7). Google's security team reported the zero-day to Apple, which issued a patch on March 26 through an iOS update.</p><p>The two Chrome vulnerabilities were renderer remote code execution zero-days and are believed to have been used by the same actor. Both of the zero-days were targeting the latest versions of Chrome on Windows and were delivered as one-time links sent via email to the targets. When a target clicked the link, they were sent to attacker-controlled domains and their device was fingerprinted for information that the attackers used to determine whether or not to deliver the exploit. Google said all of targets were in Armenia.</p><p>With the Internet Explorer vulnerability, Google said its researchers discovered a campaign targeting Armenian users with malicious Office documents that loaded web content within the browser.</p><p>"Based on our analysis, we assess that the Chrome and Internet Explorer exploits described here were developed and sold by the same vendor providing surveillance capabilities to customers around the world," Google said.</p><p>Google also published root cause analysis for all four zero-days:</p><p>- CVE-2021-1879: Use-After-Free in QuickTimePluginReplacement</p><p>- CVE-2021-21166: Chrome Object Lifecycle Issue in Audio</p><p>- CVE-2021-30551: Chrome Type Confusion in V8</p><p>- CVE-2021-33742: Internet Explorer out-of-bounds write in MSHTML</p>|14|
