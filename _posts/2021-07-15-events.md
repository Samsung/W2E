|exploit|['safari', 'linkedin', 'browser', 'iphones']|<p>Researchers shed light on how attackers exploited Apple web browser vulnerabilities to target government officials in Western Europe.</p><p>Threat actors used a Safari zero-day flaw to send malicious links to government officials in Western Europe via LinkedIn before researchers from Google discovered and reported the vulnerability.</p><p>That’s the word from researchers from Google Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Google Project Zero, who Wednesday <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/how-we-protect-users-0-day-attacks/">posted a blog</a> shedding more light on several zero-day flaws that they discovered so far this year. Researchers in particular detailed how attackers exploited the vulnerabilities—the prevalence of which are on the rise–before they were addressed by their respective vendors.</p><p>TAG researchers discovered the Safari WebKit flaw, tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-1879">CVE-​2021-1879</a>, on March 19. The vulnerability allowed for the processing of maliciously crafted web content for universal cross site scripting and was addressed by Apple in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212256">an update</a> later that month.</p><p>Before the fix, researchers assert Russian-language threat actors were exploiting the vulnerability in the wild by using LinkedIn Messaging to send government officials from Western European countries malicious links that could collect website-authentication cookies, according to the post by Maddie Stone and Clement Lecigne from Google TAG.</p><p>“If the target visited the link from an iOS device, they would be redirected to an attacker-controlled domain that served the next-stage payloads,” they wrote.</p><p>The exploit, which targeted iOS versions 12.4 through 13.7, would turn off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-Origin-Policy</a> protections on an infected device to collect authentication cookies from several popular websites–including Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, Facebook and Yahoo–and then send them via WebSocket to an attacker-controlled IP, researchers wrote. The victim would need to have a session open on these websites from Safari for cookies to be successfully exfiltrated.</p><p>Moreover, the campaign targeting iOS devices coincided with others from the same threat actor—which Microsoft has identified as Nobelium–targeting users on Windows devices to deliver Cobalt Strike, researchers wrote. Security firm Volexity described one of these attacks <a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/">in a report</a> posted online in May, the researchers added.</p><p>Nobellium is believed to be a Russia-based threat group responsible for the <a href="https://threatpost.com/feds-russia-culprit-solarwinds/162785/">expansive cyber-espionage SolarWinds</a> campaign, which affected numerous U.S. government agencies and tech companies, including Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Other Zero-Day Attacks</strong></p><p>Google researchers also linked three additional zero-day flaws they identified this year to a commercial surveillance vendor, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/ShaneHuntley/status/1415340345500463113">Google TAG’s Shane Huntley</a>. Two of those vulnerabilities–<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21166">CVE-2021-21166</a> and <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30551">CVE-2021-30551</a>—were found in Chrome, and one, tracked as <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-33742">CVE-2021-33742</a>, in Internet Explorer.</p><p>CVE-2021-21166 and CVE-2021-30551, two Chrome rendered remote-code execution (RCE) flaws, were identified separately but later believed to be used by the same actor, researchers wrote in the blog. Google researchers discovered the former in February and the latter in June.</p><p>“Both of these 0-days were delivered as one-time links sent by email to the targets, all of whom we believe were in Armenia,” Stone and Lecigne wrote. “The links led to attacker-controlled domains that mimicked legitimate websites related to the targeted users.”</p><p>When prospective victims clicked the link, they were redirected to a webpage that would fingerprint their device, collect system information about the client, and generate ECDH keys to encrypt the exploits, researchers wrote. This info—which included screen resolution, timezone, languages, browser plugins, and available MIME types—would then be sent back to the exploit server and used by attackers to decide whether or not an exploit should be delivered to the target, they said.</p><p>Researchers also identified a separate campaigned in April that also targeted Armenian users by leveraging CVE-2021-26411, an RCE bug found in Internet Explorer (IE). The campaign loaded web content within IE that contained malicious Office documents, researchers wrote.</p><p>“This happened by either embedding a remote ActiveX object using a Shell.Explorer.1 OLE object or by spawning an Internet Explorer process via VBA macros to navigate to a web page,” Stone and Lecigne explained.</p><p>At the time, researchers said they were unable to recover the next-stage payload, but successfully recovered the exploit after discovering an early June campaign from the same actors. Microsoft patched the flaw later that month, they said.</p><p><strong>Why There is an Increase in Zero-Days?</strong></p><p>All in all, security researchers have identified 33 <a href="https://threatpost.com/kaseya-patches-zero-days-revil-attacks/167670/">zero-day flaws</a> so far in 2021, which is 11 more than the total number from 2020, according to the post.</p><p>While that trend reflects an increase in the number of these types of vulnerabilities that exist, Google researchers “believe greater detection and disclosure efforts are also contributing to the upward trend,” they wrote.</p><p>Still, it’s highly possible that attackers are indeed using more <a href="https://threatpost.com/zero-day-wipe-my-book-live/167422/">zero-day exploits</a> for a few reasons, researchers noted. One is that the increase and maturation of security technologies and features means attackers also have to level up, which in turn requires more <a href="https://threatpost.com/solarwinds-hotfix-zero-day-active-attack/167704/">zero-day vulnerabilities</a> for functional attack chains, they said.</p><p>The growth of mobile platforms also has resulted in an increase in the number of products that threat actors want to target—hence more reason to use zero-day exploits, researchers observed. Perhaps inspired by this increase in demand, commercial vendors also are selling more access to zero-days than in the early 2010s, they said.</p><p>Finally, the maturation of security protections and strategies also inspires sophistication on the part of attackers as well, boosting the need for them to use zero-day flaws to convince victims to install malware, researchers noted.</p><p>“Due to advancements in security, these actors now more often have to use 0-day exploits to accomplish their goals,” Stone and Lecigne wrote.</p>|7|
|malware|['candiru', 'sourgum', 'browser', 'cyberweapons']|<p>The Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) alongside the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) has uncovered a private-sector offensive actor, or PSOA, that we are calling SOURGUM in possession of now-patched, Windows 0-day exploits (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-31979">CVE-2021-31979</a> and <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-33771">CVE-2021-33771</a>).</p><p>Private-sector offensive actors are private companies that manufacture and sell cyberweapons in hacking-as-a-service packages, often to government agencies around the world, to hack into their targets’ computers, phones, network infrastructure, and other devices. With these hacking packages, usually the government agencies choose the targets and run the actual operations themselves. The tools, tactics, and procedures used by these companies only adds to the complexity, scale, and sophistication of attacks. We take these threats seriously and have moved swiftly alongside our partners to build in the latest protections for our customers.</p><p>MSTIC believes SOURGUM is an Israel-based private-sector offensive actor. We would like to thank the Citizen Lab, at the University of Toronto’s Munk School, for sharing the sample of malware that initiated this work and their collaboration during the investigation. In their <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/07/hooking-candiru-another-mercenary-spyware-vendor-comes-into-focus/">blog</a>, Citizen Lab asserts with high confidence that SOURGUM is an Israeli company commonly known as Candiru. <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/.premium-top-secret-israeli-cyberattack-firm-revealed-1.6805950">Third-party reports</a> indicate Candiru produces “hacking tools [that] are used to break into computers and servers”<em>. </em></p><p>As we shared in the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/07/15/cyberweapons-cybersecurity-sourgum-malware/">Microsoft on the Issues blog</a>, Microsoft and Citizen Lab have worked together to disable the malware being used by SOURGUM that targeted more than 100 victims around the world including politicians, human rights activists, journalists, academics, embassy workers, and political dissidents. To limit these attacks, Microsoft has created and built protections into our products against this unique malware, which we are calling <em>DevilsTongue</em>. We have shared these protections with the security community so that we can collectively address and mitigate this threat. We have also issued a software update that will protect Windows customers from the associated exploits that the actor used to help deliver its highly sophisticated malware.</p>|19|

|vulnerability|['mediatek']|<p>Security experts are raising concerns over the “Freedom Phone,” a new device touted by prominent conservatives as both secure and censorship-resistant.</p><p>Unveiled on Wednesday by Erik Finman, the world’s youngest bitcoin millionaire, the $500 Freedom Phone claims to offer a series of robust privacy features as well as an uncensorable app store.</p><p>Finman states the Freedom Phone runs on a custom Android operating system known as “FreedomOS” and provides access to apps such as Parler, the social media service which had previously been banned from app stores in the wake of the Capitol riot.</p><p>The phone’s launch also came alongside numerous endorsements from popular right-wing figures such as Jack Posobiec and Candace Owens, who both offered their followers discount codes for the device. It remains unclear whether either individual is receiving financial kickbacks for promoting the Freedom Phone.</p><p>Yet security experts are raising serious questions about the device, noting that the website for the Freedom Phone does not provide any pertinent information regarding its specifications or source code.</p><p>Matthew Hickey, co-founder of the cybersecurity firm <a href="https://hacker.house/">Hacker House</a>, told the Daily Dot that the Freedom Phone appears to be nothing more than a rebranded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919XTB6M/ref=cm_sw_r_as_gl_api_glt_fabc_dl_14AQXZ2EGDHP33NWPNPK?linkCode=ml1&amp;tag=barnacnerdg08-20">Umidigi A9 Pro</a>—a Chinese smartphone that costs as little as $119 on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001468394552.html">AliExpress</a>.</p><p>“This device is a drop-shipped customizable Android-based phone,” Hickey said. “They can be bought and shipped in bulk from Asia with custom logos and branding so as to give the appearance of a phone that has been designed for a unique purpose.”</p><p>Hickey added that the phone is notorious for its poor security due largely to its use of processors from MediaTek, a Taiwanese company that provides chips for smartphones.</p><p>“I have never encountered a secure MediaTek device in my entire life,” Hickey said. “Using MediaTek for anything and expecting privacy or security is fundamentally flawed.”</p><p>Hickey even stated that MediaTek’s processors are widely used in smartphones throughout North Korea due to their “highly customizable nature and low-security barrier,” which allows the regime to easily implement surveillance backdoors.</p><p>The Daily Dot reached out to Freedom Phone to inquire about the device’s specifications but did not receive a reply. Questions about potential security issues also went unanswered.</p><p>Other issues surround the Freedom Phone’s app store, known as PatriApp. The company has not explained what protections, if any, have been put in place to ensure that malware is kept from being introduced.</p><p>“The Google and Apple app stores implement a rigorous code inspection process before making applications available. And whilst this is not foolproof, it helps prevent a wide range of common malware being loaded onto devices,” Hickey said. “The Freedom Phone offers an app store that promises not to censor apps but has not made it clear how it will perform this vital process while keeping out malware.”</p><p>With almost no information provided about the device from Freedom Phone thus far, major questions still remain. And without access to the operating system’s source code, users won’t know what exactly their phone is doing in the background.</p><p>But perhaps they will feel free from the shackles of big tech as they download virus after virus.</p>|1|
