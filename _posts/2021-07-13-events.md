|exploit|['cve-2021-35464', 'forgerock', 'openam']|ACSC: Australian organizations compromised through ForgeRock vulnerability  Vulnerability is CVE-2021-35464, a pre-auth RCE in ForgeRock OpenAM, an identity management solution used across enterprises.  https://t.co/zUgX8X6XLw https://t.co/q18pKuYx9Y|19|
|exploit|['cve-2021-22779', 'plcs', 'modicon', 'modipwn', 'scada', 'armis', 'plc', 'hvacs']|<p><a href="https://img2.helpnetsecurity.com/posts2021/CVE-2021-22779-armis.jpg"></a></p><p>Researchers at Armis discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2021-22779) in Schneider Electric‚Äôs Modicon programmable logic controllers (PLCs) that can lead to remote-code-execution (RCE).</p><p>The vulnerability, dubbed ModiPwn, allows for a complete takeover of impacted devices by leveraging the UMAS protocol, and impacts Modicon M340, M580 and other models from the Modicon series.</p><p>Millions of these PLCs and are now deemed to be at risk in what is considered to be a widescale vulnerability. Such controllers are used widely in manufacturing, building services, automation applications, energy utilities, HVAC systems to name but a few.</p><p><strong>How would an attacker take advantage of this vulnerability?</strong></p><p>An attack that leverages ModiPwn would begin with network access to a Modicon PLC. Through this access, the attacker can leverage undocumented commands in the <a href="https://documentation.stormshield.eu/SNS/v4/en/Content/User_Configuration_Manual_SNS_v4/Protocols/SCADA-UMAS.htm">UMAS protocol</a> and leak a certain hash from the device‚Äôs memory.</p><p>Using this hash, the attacker can take over the secure connection between the controller and its managing workstation to reconfigure the controller with a password-less configuration. This will allow the attacker to abuse additional undocumented commands that lead to remote-code-execution ‚Äì a full takeover of the device.</p><p>This takeover can then be used to install malware on the controller that alters its operation and hide the existence of these alterations from the workstation that manages this controller.</p><p>Sophisticated attacks such as this have been seen in the wild before; the Triton malware, for example, was spotted targeting safety controllers by Schneider Electric used in petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia. Attacks that alter operations of industrial controllers are a threat to both business continuity and safety, and attacks that hide from monitoring solutions can be extremely difficult to detect.</p><p><strong>Mitigations are available</strong></p><p>A patch that fully mitigates the issues is still under development, but Schneider Electric has issued a <a href="https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2021-194-01">security advisory</a> that includes mitigation steps.</p><p>‚ÄúArmis and Schneider Electric have worked together to ensure the proper security mitigations are being provided. We urge all affected organizations to take action now,‚Äù said Ben Seri, Armis.</p><p>‚ÄúThe trouble with these legacy devices found in OT environments is that historically, they have evolved over unencrypted protocols. It will take time to address these weak underlying protocols. In the meantime, organizations operating in these environments should ensure that they have visibility over these devices to see where their points of exposure lie. This is crucial to preventing attackers from being able to control their systems ‚Äì or even hold them to ransom,‚Äù Seri concluded.</p>|22|

|vulnerability|['iphone']|<p><p>Carl Schou, founder of an informal hacker collective known as <a href="https://secret.club/about">Secret Club</a>, ‚Äúcreated originally as a gag between friends who are passionate about technical subjects‚Äù, seems to have been doing what bug-hunters do and trying out a range of potentially risky values in the Wi-Fi settings on his iPhone.</p><p>Schou set up a Wi-Fi access point with a network name (ESSID) of %p%s%s%s%s%n, and then deliberately connected his iPhone to it in order to check for what are known as <em>format string vulnerabilities</em>.</p><p>This sort of vulnerability is considered somewhat old-school these days, but as we have had good reason to say many times on Naked Security, ‚Äúnever assume anything‚Äù in the world of cybersecurity, and it seems that Schou followed this advice, and unexpectedly unearthed up a genuine bug.</p><p>The name <em>format string vulnerability</em> comes from a standard, widely-used system function, found in almost every operating system, known as printf(), shorthand for <em>format and print data</em>.</p><p>In practice, programmers may not actually call the printf() function directly, but frequently write code that ends up calling either printf() itself or a related system function that works in the same way.</p><p>The idea is simple: you use a so-called format string to specify how you want the output to look, and you then hand the function all the values that you want to print out.</p><p>In the format string, a percent (%) character acts as a placeholder for each of the values you want to print, typically followed by a letter to denote how to do the formatting.</p><p>For example, %s means <em>print as a text string</em>, %c says to <em>print a single character</em>, %d denotes <em>print as a decimal integer</em>, and %p (intended for debugging output) means <em>print as a formatted memory address</em>, also known as a pointer.</p><p><strong>One quick fix</strong></p><p>One potential fix, quickly circulated, is to use Settings &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings to return to a ‚Äúdisconnected from everything‚Äù state, and then to reconnect manually to a legitimate access point that doesn‚Äôt trigger this bug.</p><p>Apparently, however, this fix doesn‚Äôt always work, depending on what other ESSIDs you have connected to before.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><p>- Avoid Wi-Fi networks with percent signs in their names. They‚Äôve probably been set up recently by hackers who think it‚Äôs amusing to foist annoying and troublesome bugs onto other people.</p><p>- Don‚Äôt put percent signs in your network name. In the unlikely event that you have such a network name, consider changing it as a favour to everyone else. Don‚Äôt set up poisoned access points as a joke. You‚Äôd just be showing off, and you won‚Äôt be helping anyone, not even yourself.</p></p>|4|
