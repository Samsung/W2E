|vulnerability|['mt6771']|<p>Devices with MediaTek chipsets have a BROM (boot read-only memory), which typically loads the preloader executable and subsequently boots the Android system, but also houses an alternative boot mode known as Download mode. It is strictly intended for OEM servicing and can be used to unbrick a device, just like Qualcomm‚Äôs Emergency Download Mode (EDL). A MediaTek-made proprietary program called ‚ÄúSP Flash Tool‚Äù can utilize this interface to force flash the system software on a device. Since the low-level download mode effectively has full control over the device‚Äôs storage, many OEMs including Xiaomi and Realme have started obfuscating the flashing process. Because of this practice, firmware flashing via download mode can only be performed by a signed ‚ÄúDownload Agent‚Äù program that has been authorized by the corresponding OEM, essentially meaning that you can‚Äôt flash or unbrick your own smartphone unless you have permission from the device maker to do so.</p><p>Well, XDA‚Äôs fantastic developer community has once again come to the rescue. Based on a boot ROM-exploit originally discovered by XDA Senior Member xyz`, developers Dinolek and k4y0z have come up with a generic bypass method, which is compatible with a wide variety of MediaTek-powered devices that would otherwise require authentication while flashing. The method, which makes use of SoC-specific exploit payloads, intercepts the pre-flash queries made by SP Flash Tool and forcefully set the values of two crucial parameters (‚ÄúSerial Link Authentication‚Äù and ‚ÄúDownload Agent Authentication‚Äú) as false in order to continue the flashing process without any kind of authorization.</p><p><strong>Bypassing SP Flash Tool authentication</strong></p><p>It‚Äôs important to note that the exploit payloads require a specially-tweaked USB driver for a successful interception. If you‚Äôre running Windows, you have to install a libusb-based filter driver to override the default driverset. Linux users, on the other hand, need to apply a specific patch to the kernel. In case you don‚Äôt want to touch your primary operating system, you can make use of FireISO ‚Äì a bootable GNU/Linux ISO designed specifically for this purpose.</p><p>When it comes to accessing the MediaTek download mode, you just need to turn off the target device, hold down the Volume Up button (Volume Down for Xiaomi phones), and plug your phone into your PC. You should see a new serial device listed under Device Manager (Windows) or in the output of dmesg \| grep usb (Linux).</p>|2|

|exploit|['pegasusproject', 'pegasus']|Good point from Bill here about the non-persistent 0-click exploit used by Pegasus being a feature, not a drawback. #PegasusProject https://t.co/NF08Nzsigv|1|

|exploit|['imageio', 'jpeg']|Phone logs show that (at least some of) the iOS 13.x and 14.x zero-click exploits deployed by NSO Group involved ImageIO, specifically the parsing JPEG and GIF images. ImageIO has had more than a dozen high-severity bugs reported against it in 2021.|3|

|malware|['pegasusproject', 'pegasus', 'zero-click', 'imessage', 'explainer']|Massive abuses of NSO's Pegasus spyware uncovered by @AmnestyTech @FbdnStories  #PegasusProject  We @citizenlab were asked to verify analysis and undertake a peer review of methods, and found them all sound.

|malware|['0-clicks']|Because the 0-clicks they're using appear to be quite reliable, the lack of traditional "persistence" is a feature, not a drawback of the spyware.  It makes the spyware more nimble, and prevents recovery of the "good stuff" (i.e., the spyware and exploits) from forensic analysis|2|
|privacy|['imessage']|The thing that makes identifying NSO hard is that iMessage is encrypted, and Apple doesn‚Äôt want to upload every suspicious payload for privacy reasons (but also I think because they don‚Äôt even have the infrastructure to do so.) https://t.co/q8g4VCmcPY|1|
